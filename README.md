This will be my attempt at making a modding framework for the game "Schedule I"
Still much to do starting out, but I do plan to actually work on this heavily.

Yes, most of the code is has been jump started with AI, I am not saying that I don't have any experience with it, I understand the code pretty well but I have never made a mod for this game since it has just came out. I will be utilizing tools like UnityExplorer and dnSpy to see how this game functions more in-depthly. Heavy re-work is planned, atm my hands are really tied up and I have to focus on other things.
