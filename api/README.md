This will be my attempt at making a modding framework for the game "Schedule I"
Still much to do starting out, but I do plan to actually work on this heavily.

This is a temporary file tree, still figuring out how on I can execute this properly. (As of making this repository and writing this, I have got no sleep so don't be expecting anything yet if you come accross this searching for mods or something. [10:07am EST. @ 4/12/25])
